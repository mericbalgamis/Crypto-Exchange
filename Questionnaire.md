* Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?

  Yes, I did not use a database like H2 or MongoDB due to limited time.  
  
* Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)

  No, I did not over-designed any part due to time limitation. If I had more time, I could design and visualize the cryptocurrency data better. 
  
* If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?

  I would carry the application to Cloud and create multiple hosts and choose the correct database to scale read and write time.

* What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation

  As I mentioned before, I could visualize the cryptocurrency data better. Also I would have create a database for cryptocurrency data to make a more detailed recommendation following the past records of the cryptocurrency data.
